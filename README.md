## Angular Training

Training project used to guide new Angular developers down the path of creating their first single page application (SPA).

If you're interested in checking out the documentation automatically generated by the Angular CLI you can [check it out here][AngularGeneratedReadme].

### Getting started

1. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
2. As you work through each step you can serve it by running:

```Bash
# Valid steps:
# - final-solution
# - step1-answer
# - step1-solution
# - step2-answer
# - step2-solution

./run-step.sh step1-answer # serves the code from step1's answer directory.
```

**Additional information**:

`./run-step.sh` is used when you would like to run the mock server along with a given step.

If you would like to run two steps side by side you can do so by doing the following:

1. Use a terminal and run `./run-step.sh <target step>`.
    + This will start the mock server and the provided step.
2. Open another terminal and run `ng serve <target step> --port 4300`.
    + This will run a step on the provided port without attempting to start the mock server since it is already running.

Now two different Angular applications will be running on different ports, and you can open them side by side for comparison.
