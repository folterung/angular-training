## Angular Training

Training project used to guide new Angular developers down the path of creating their first single page application (SPA).

If you're interesting in checking out the documentation automatically generated by the Angular CLI you can [check it out here][AngularGeneratedReadme].

### Getting started

1. Install dependencies needed for the mock-api by running `npm install` from root of this project.
2. As you work through different steps within the project make sure to navigate to that step's answer directory, run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies, and run `npm start` to see that step running live in its completed form.

**To see the final solution up and running you can navigate to the `final-solution` directory, install the dependencies via `npm install`, and run `npm start` to see the project in action.**
